# StockCalculator.js Documentation

## Overview
The StockCalculator component provides a simple yet powerful tool for users to calculate potential earnings or losses from stock investments within the Portfolio Management Recommendation System. It enables quick "what-if" scenarios by combining current market data with user-defined investment parameters.

## Purpose
This component serves as a financial planning tool that helps users evaluate investment opportunities by calculating potential returns based on the current market prices. It bridges the gap between raw stock data and actionable financial insights by contextualizing price information in terms of actual investment outcomes.

## Key Components

- `stockSymbol`: Tracks the currently selected stock for calculation
- `numShares`: Manages the user-entered number of shares
- `initialInvestment`: Holds the user-specified initial investment amount
- `earnings`: Stores the calculated earnings/loss result
- `loading`: Controls loading state during API requests
- `error`: Handles error messages for user feedback

### Stock Selection

```
